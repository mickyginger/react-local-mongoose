  name: 'Gorgonzola',

  strength: 5,
  tastingNotes: 'Gorgonzola is traditionally a rich creamy cheese, but the blue-green ripples add a sharp spicy flavor that provides an excellent contrast to its richness. The taste ranges from mild to sharp, depending on age.',

  name: 'Caerphilly',
  origin: 'Wales',

  tastingNotes: 'This young cheese has an ivory white rind with a pale colored paste and semi-firm texture. It\'s a moist, crumbly cheese, and its flavor is usually described as salty buttermilk, slightly sour, but buttery.',

  name: 'Roquefort',
  origin: 'France',
  strength: 4,
  tastingNotes: 'Roquefort has a tingly pungent taste, a distinct bouquet, and a flavor that combines the sweet burnt-caramel taste of sheep\'s milk with the sharp, metallic tang of the blue mold.',

  tastingNotes: 'Milder than Roquefort or Gorgonzola, Stilton has a rich and mellow flavor with a pungent aftertaste. The finest Stilton is creamy with a subtle, yeasty sweetness and a salty, nutty finish.'

  tastingNotes: 'Port Salut is a semi-soft natural cheese that is most recognized by its orange rind. Don’t be put off by the smell—which can be strong because it’s a washed rind cheese. It will still have a relatively mild flavor—savory and slightly sweet. The smell will increase the longer the cheese is kept but, again, the smell doesn’t affect its flavor.'

  tastingNotes: 'Although it\'s usually eaten as a table cheese, try it shaved on top of fresh beans, summer salads, or lightly sautéed greens. Use it instead of Parmigiano on your next bowl of pasta. Its flavor is dense and nutty with a wonderful rustic finish.'

  tastingNotes: 'Greece\'s most famous traditional cheese, feta is an important part of the Greek diet and is used daily in salads, pastries, and a simple (and simply delicious) fried-cheese appetizer called "saganaki". The fact that it\'s made primarily from pure ewe\'s milk (often with some goat\'s milk) and ripened and stored in brine gives feta a salty, milky, slightly acidic taste.'

  tastingNotes: 'Manchego has a distinctive flavor and an equally distinctive look. It can be recognized by a unique zigzag or cross hatch pattern on its black-gray or buff-colored rind which is created by the rippled surface of the press used to make it. Don’t eat the rind—it’s inedible— but inside you’ll discover an ivory-colored interior with several small holes that’s a real treat.'
